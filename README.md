# Level One Summary

As a group, we created separate scenes to work independently to prevent merge conflicts and later combined our work. Please see Combat Scene Demo 

More Specifically...

Daniel:
Implemented player movement, player dodge action, background art, background tilemaps, character art, character movement animations, and camera movement to follow the player.

Kyle:
Implemented basic attack, creates prefab of a slash effect that is short range to act as a basic attack. Implemented player/enemy health and methods for enemies and players to take damage and die. Created scriptable objects for specific game events and stats for players and enemies.

Shenran:
Figured out random enemy spawning within player's radius and have the enemy move towards the enemy. Implemented the logic of letter drop when enemies die (letters used in our attacks have a higher chance of being dropped). Created an inventory to store the letters. Brainstormed potential theme for the letter.
